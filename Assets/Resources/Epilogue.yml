    And so we watched.
    
    We watched the stars burn their last, 
    some going quietly, some screaming across the sky.
    We watched creation play in reverse,
    existence freezing into half-light,
    collapsing into an ever-quiet whimper.
    
    Once I thought to escape.
    
    Only escape from this mortal road could make us God, 
    yet I cannot help remember one enigma, one anomaly,
    
    a single element, unaccounted for.
    
    Now, in my last breath, 
    in the final moment, before all becomes one, 
    I know who you are.
    
    
    
    
    You are Mallowdog.
