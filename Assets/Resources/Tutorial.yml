    Amazing!
    The creatures who live on this planet also have an **ODD PROPENSITY** to **PUZZLES**. 
    These **PUZZLES** are **ANNOYING** and I **DISLIKE** them. 
    You will have to **SOLVE** them **SOMETIMES**. Solve this one!


    ####My **INSTINCTS** tell me you might need it later.
    #Since you are a marshmallow, you can **STRETCH**, **SQUISH**, and **Jump**!
    #Then, you can fit into any **NOOK** or **CRANNY** you want.
    #Press the **DOWN ARROW** and the **UP ARROW** to **STRETCH** or **SQUISH** yourself.
    #Press **SPACE** to jump onto that platform over there!
