    Spectacular! You picked it up. My studies of EARTH have informed me that the thing you picked up is
    called a GUN. It is a WEAPON used to HURT THINGS. Why don’t you give it a go? Press [BUTTON].

    EARTH is also full of STRANGE NOOKS AND CRANNIES. My studies of EARTH have taught me that these
    are VERY ANNOYING for HUMANS. But since you are a marshmallow, you should have NO PROBLEMO!
    Just SQUISH YOURSELF. Press the DOWN KEY.

    The creatures who live on this planet also have an ODD PROPENSITY to construct PUZZLES. These
    PUZZLES are ANNOYING and I DISLIKE them. You will have to SOLVE them SOMETIMES. Solve this one!
